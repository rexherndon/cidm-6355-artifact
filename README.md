# Disclaimer:

This assignment was originally intended as the final project for my “Data Mining Methods” class (CIDM-6355) taught by Dr. Liang (Leon) Chen at West Texas A&M University in the Fall 2023 semester. Since then, this assignment has been published to this GitHub repository as a part of developing my portfolio for my M.S. Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics Capstone Course (CIDM-6395) taught by Dr. Jeffry Babb. 

This group project consists of contributions made by myself, alongside my other colleagues, Cecilia Foy, Brandon Koch, Mohammadsalim Shaikh, and Jordan Unfred.
